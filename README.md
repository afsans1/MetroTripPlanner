# A2 Metro Trip Planner

Express + React app

Description: (briefly describe what the app does)

## Structure

There are two directories in the __root__ of the project.

* The Express server is in `server/`
* The React app is in `metro-client/
* The server responds to API calls and serves the __built__ React app.

There are 3 package.json files -- see what `scripts` they define.

```
npm run build
```
